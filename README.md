I have the tables.  Have the Tenants, Datalinks and some User management going on.
So now, the task is, when admin logs in, there should be a choice of Tenants for the admin to start from the TenantUser table.
Once the Tenant is selected, the Tenant ID should go into a Session variable and managing the list of products should begin.

There is default data created, so, that should requires undoing in due course.
